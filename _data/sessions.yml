  title: "How to Learn an Algorithm"
  description: "Our general problem solvers search the space of algorithms running on general purpose computers with internal memory. Architectures include traditional computers, Turing machines, recurrent neural networks, fast weight networks, stack machines, and others. Some of our algorithm searchers are asymptotically time-optimal. Some are self-referential and can even learn the learning algorithm itself (recursive self-improvement). Some reinforcement-learn without a teacher to solve very deep algorithmic problems involving billions of steps. And algorithms learned by our Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks defined the state-of-the-art in handwriting recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, image caption generation, etc. Google and others made them available to a billion users."
