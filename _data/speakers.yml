  name: "Prof. Dr. Jürgen"
  surname: "Schmidhuber"
  company: "IDSIA"
  title: "Deep Learning Pioneer"
  bio: "Since age 15 or so, Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber's main scientific ambition has been to build a self-improving Artificial Intelligence (AI) smarter than himself, then retire. He has pioneered self-improving general problem solvers since 1987, and Deep Learning Neural Networks (NNs) since 1991. The recurrent NNs (RNNs) developed by his research groups at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA & USI & SUPSI and TU Munich were the first RNNs to win official international contests. They have revolutionised connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, optical character recognition, image caption generation, and are now in use at Google, Microsoft, IBM, Baidu, and many other companies. The first 4 members of DeepMind (sold to Google for over 600M) include 2 former PhD students from his lab. His team's Deep Learners were also the first to win object detection and image segmentation contests, and achieved the world's first superhuman visual classification results, winning nine international competitions in machine learning & pattern recognition (more than any other team). They also were the first to learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. His research group also established the field of mathematically rigorous universal AI and optimal universal problem solvers. His formal theory of creativity & curiosity & fun explains art, science, music, and humor. He also generalized algorithmic information theory and the many-worlds theory of physics, and introduced the concept of Low-Complexity Art, the information age's extreme form of minimal art. Since 2009 he has been member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. He has published 333 peer-reviewed papers, earned seven best paper/best video awards, the 2013 Helmholtz Award of the International Neural Networks Society, and the 2016 IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer Award. He is president of NNAISENSE, which aims at building the first practical general purpose AI."

  name: "Prof. Dr. Volker"
  surname: "Tresp"
  company: "Siemens"
  title: "Principal Research Scientist"
  bio: "Volker Tresp received a Diploma degree from the University of Goettingen, Germany, in 1984 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University, New Haven, CT, in 1986 and 1989 respectively. Since 1989 he is the head of various research teams in machine learning at Siemens, Research and Technology.  He filed more than 70 patent applications and was inventor of the year of Siemens in 1996. He has published more than 100 scientific articles and administered over 20 Ph.D. theses. The company Panoratio is a spin-off out of his team.  His research focus in recent years has been „Machine Learning in Information Networks“ for modelling Knowledge Graphs, medical decision processes and sensor networks. He is the coordinator of one of the first nationally funded Big Data projects for the realization of „Precision Medicine“.   In 2011 he became aHonorarprofessor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he teaches an annual course on Machine Learning."
